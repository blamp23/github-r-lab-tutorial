# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the GitHub + R Lab Tutorial

Each student will:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Add a `.qmd` file in the `people/` folder
4. Commit and push their changes
5. Open a pull request (or push to `main` directly)

When we re-render the website, all student pages will appear in one place!


## Student Pages

```{r}
files <- list.files("people", pattern = "\\.qmd$", full.names = TRUE)
names <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(files))
cat(paste0("- [", names, "](people/", names, ".html)\n"), sep = "")
```
